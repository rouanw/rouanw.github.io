## Build software better

How do you build software incrementally while maintaining good design? Is that cake?

## DevOps is a culture

The DevOps movement is about much more than tools. The 2015 State of DevOps report confirmed that organisations that excel at creating software are the ones with a more diverse workforce and a culture of sustainable pace.

Although many tools are useful, it is primarily a cultural change." %}

## Software is eating the world

How quickly can you respond to change? Do you care about feedback? Is your team supported and responsive? Is your code an asset? Do you know which way to go?

## Engineering practices

How do you create software that is an asset to your organisation? By building quality into the process of developing software with engineering practices like Test Driven Development, pair programming, continuous integration and emergent design. The practices of Continuous Delivery help you ship code faster and more reliably.

## Polyglot programming

I've delivered systems in Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python and Ruby. Have a look at why I think __polyglot  programming__ is so important:

{% include _promo.html title="Why you should hire a polyglot programmer" type="Article in" publication="P2 Magazine" url="http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/hire-polyglot/" imageUrl="images/p2.png" description="It’s common for people to be sceptical of software developers with varied coding experience. We’re used to seeing, “5 years C# experience” on the CV in front of us, so when we see a CV that says: “2 years of Ruby, 1 year of Python and 2 years of Java”, we might be concerned that the person doesn’t have the depth of experience we need. Although this reaction is natural, it’s misguided." %}
