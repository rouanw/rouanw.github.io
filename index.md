I'm a software developer at ThoughtWorks. I'm passionate about creating software that improves peopleâ€™s lives.

## Agile engineering

I believe in building quality into the process of developing software. I'm an active practitioner of agile engineering practices like Test Driven Development, pair programming, continuous integration and emergent design. I help teams work towards Continuous Delivery, so that they can put new features in production all the time.

## Polyglot programming

I've delivered systems in Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python and Ruby. Have a look at why I think [polyglot  programming](http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/hire-polyglot/) is so important.

## Consulting

I've consulted to clients in the financial services, health, media and education sectors. I've worked as an agile coach, helping teams learn agile practices and helping organisations change the way they deliver software.
