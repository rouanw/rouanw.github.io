## Consulting

I've consulted to clients in the financial services, health, media and education sectors. I've worked as an agile coach, helping teams learn agile practices and helping organisations change the way they deliver software to their customers. Take a look at my thoughts on __what makes an organisation agile__:

## Agile engineering

I believe in building quality into the process of developing software. I'm an active practitioner of agile engineering practices like Test Driven Development, pair programming, continuous integration and emergent design. I help teams work towards __Continuous Delivery__, so that they can put new features in production all the time.

## Polyglot programming

I've delivered systems in Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python and Ruby. Have a look at why I think __polyglot  programming__ is so important:
{% include _promo.html title="Why you should hire a polyglot programmer" type="Article in" publication="P2 Magazine" url="http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/hire-polyglot/" imageUrl="images/p2.png" description="It’s common for people to be sceptical of software developers with varied coding experience. We’re used to seeing, “5 years C# experience” on the CV in front of us, so when we see a CV that says: “2 years of Ruby, 1 year of Python and 2 years of Java”, we might be concerned that the person doesn’t have the depth of experience we need. Although this reaction is natural, it’s misguided." %}
