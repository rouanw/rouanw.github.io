## DevOps is about culture

The DevOps movement is about much more than tools. Organisations that excel at creating software are the ones with a more diverse workforce and a culture of sustainable pace.

## No more guessing

Stop worrying about what might happen. Rather equip yourself to find out  when something goes wrong and set yourself up to ship fixes fast.

It’s an opportunity to learn about your system and the real world with which it interacts. With the right production monitoring tools and a good Continuous Delivery pipeline, you can build a set of feedback mechanisms that help you find out about issues as they happen and ship fixes quickly. Adopting production QA practices can help you gain a richer understanding of the real issues your system faces and learn new ways to improve its quality." %}
