## About me

I'm a software developer at ThoughtWorks. I'm passionate about creating software that improves peopleâ€™s lives.

I've consulted to clients in the financial services, health, media and education sectors. I've worked as an agile coach, helping teams learn agile practices and helping organisations change the way they deliver software to their customers.

I believe in building quality into the process of developing software. I'm an active practitioner of agile engineering practices like Test Driven Development, pair programming, continuous integration and emergent design. I help teams work towards __Continuous Delivery__, so that they can put new features in production all the time.

I'm a polyglot programmer and have delivered systems in Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python and Ruby.
