## About me

I'm a software developer at ThoughtWorks. I've spent the past few years working as a consultant to clients in the financial services, health, media and education sectors.

I enjoy helping teams find better ways of working together and building software. I've coached team on agile practices, especially software engineering practices such as Test Driven Development, Emergent Design and Continuous Integration. I have helped teams automate their release process from check-in to production and encourage [DevOps Culture](http://techbeacon.com/running-gauntlet-setting-your-first-deployment-pipeline).  I consider myself to be a [polyglot programmer](http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/hire-polyglot/) and have delivered systems in Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python and Ruby.
