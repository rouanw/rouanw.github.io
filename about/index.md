## About me

I'm a software developer at ThoughtWorks. I've spent the past few years working as a consultant, developing applications for clients in the financial services, health, media and education sectors.

### Coding and coaching

I enjoy helping teams find better ways of working together and building software. I've coached teams on agile practices, especially software engineering practices such as Test Driven Development, [Emergent Design](http://www.slideshare.net/rouanw/emergent-design-cakes-showers-and-electricians) and [Continuous Integration](http://www.slideshare.net/rouanw/continuous-integration-51794067).

I'm a [DevOps](http://techbeacon.com/running-gauntlet-setting-your-first-deployment-pipeline) and [Continuous Delivery](http://www.slideshare.net/rouanw/lets-release-it-an-intro-to-continuous-delivery) practitioner and have helped teams automate their release pipelines and deployments.

I consider myself to be a [polyglot programmer](http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/hire-polyglot/) and have delivered systems in Java, .NET, JavaScript, Python and Ruby.

### Sharing

I like learning and sharing what I learn. I've published articles on sites including [MartinFowler.com](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html), [TechBeacon](http://techbeacon.com/running-gauntlet-setting-your-first-deployment-pipeline) and [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/articles/guide-to-better-css). I also regularly speak at [conferences and user groups](/talks).

### Other stuff

I have an MA in Creative Writing from the University of East Anglia in the UK. Writing is a passion of mine. You can see a couple of my poems online: [Nocturne](http://www.newwriting.net/student_writing/nocturne/), [Tannin](http://www.newwriting.net/student_writing/tannin/).
