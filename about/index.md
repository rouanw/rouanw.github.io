<h2>About me</h2>

I'm a software developer. I've spent a number of years working as a consultant, developing applications for clients in the financial services, health, media and education sectors. I now work remotely for [Tes](http://engineering.tes.com/), where we're building software to help teachers and schools using a predominantly JavaScript microservices stack.

### Tech stuff

I enjoy helping teams find better ways of working together and building software. I've coached teams on agile practices, especially software engineering practices such as Test Driven Development, [Emergent Design](http://www.slideshare.net/rouanw/emergent-design-cakes-showers-and-electricians) and [Continuous Integration](http://www.slideshare.net/rouanw/continuous-integration-51794067).

I'm a [DevOps](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html) and [Continuous Delivery](http://www.slideshare.net/rouanw/lets-release-it-an-intro-to-continuous-delivery) enthusiast and have helped teams automate their release pipelines and deployments.

I'm a [polyglot programmer](http://thoughtworks.github.io/p2/issue09/hire-polyglot/) and have delivered systems in JavaScript, Java, .NET, Python and Ruby.

### Sharing

I like learning and sharing what I learn. I've published articles on sites including [MartinFowler.com](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/DevOpsCulture.html), [TechBeacon](https://techbeacon.com/contributors/rouan-wilsenach) and [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/articles/guide-to-better-css). I also regularly speak at [conferences and user groups](/talks).

### I don't just write code

I have an MA in Creative Writing from the University of East Anglia in the UK. Writing is a passion of mine. You can see a couple of my poems online: [Nocturne](http://www.newwriting.net/student_writing/nocturne/), [Tannin](http://www.newwriting.net/student_writing/tannin/). I'm currently working on my first novel.
