{% include _promo.html title="ðŸŽ’ Brewpack" url="https://rouanw.github.io/brewpack" imageUrl="images/brewpack.png" description="Brewpack is an open source tool that installs your favourite tools and apps on your new Mac with a single command. It uses Homebrew under the hood and lets you save all your formulae to a `packages.yml` file which can later be used to restore all your apps to a new or formatted Mac. You can also use it to host the dependencies required to join your team, so that a new team member can automatically install the things they need to be productive." %}
