## What is a polyglot programmer?

The term [polyglot](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/polyglot) refers to someone who is able to speak multiple languages. When I talk about a polyglot programmer, I'm talking about someone who is able to code in multiple languages. So, if Sue is a programmer who is comfortable coding in (say) Javascript, Ruby and Java, I'd feel okay about calling her a polyglot programmer.

## The right tool for the job

Knowing multiple languages allows you to pick the right technology for the problem you're trying to solve.

Part of the culture at [ThoughtWorks](www.thoughtworks.com) is to encourage developers to learn different languages. This is partially due to the fact that ThoughtWorkers tend to be quite geeky and like knowing lots of different languages, but is also due to the nature of the business. ThoughtWorks is a consulting company, which means that the languages we code in are most often influenced by the problems our clients are trying to solve. We use Java, Ruby, Python, Javascript, Clojure, C# and a host of other languages, depending on which language (or combination of languages) is best suited to the task at hand. We also often need to work within our clients' constraints. If they're a large organisation and all of their infrastructure runs Unix, it's unlikely that writing them a .NET application is going to be a good bet.

Most projects use multiple languages. No matter what the tech stack, modern applications often consist of a mix of languages. If you're writing a web application, it's very likely that you'll be writing some HTML, CSS and Javascript, whether you're building it using Rails or ASP.NET MVC.
